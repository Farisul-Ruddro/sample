				<p class="terms-para terms-date">Last Updated: March 27th, 2021.</p>
				
				<p class="terms-para">
The YouHold Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a legally binding agreement between any User or Merchant (as defined below) using any YouHold Service, as defined below (“you”, “your”), and BIG MMO GAME NETWORK LIMITED Registration No. HE 275770, Registered office Tseriou, 136 2nd floor, Strovolos, 2045, Limassol, Cyprus (“we”, “us”, “our”, “YouHold”)

The Terms apply to an individual user of the YouHold Platform (as defined below) for personal or household purposes (a “User”) or in your capacity as a business customer receiving payments from Users in connections with sales of goods or services (a “Merchant”), and apply to your use of a YouHold account (“Account”) and any YouHold products and services that you access using an Account (the “YouHold Services”) on the YouHold Platform. By accepting the Terms of Services you are also expressly agreeing to accept the YouHold Privacy Policy. YouHold is planning to offer a software platform that will allow Users to make certain payments and preauthorizations and, from time to time, receive payments, including to Merchants using an Internet connection and the YouHold software platform, including, but not limited to, smartphone and computer applications (“YouHold Platform”).

THESE TERMS APPLY TO A WORK-IN-PROGRESS SET OF SERVICES AND SOFTWARE. YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THAT ALL OR PART OF THE INFORMATION CONTAIN IN THESE TERMS AND ON THE YOUHOLD.NET WEBSITE MAY BE PROVIDED FOR THE PURPOSES OF MARKETING, COLLECTING FEEDBACK, AND FINALIZING THE YOUHOLD PLATFORM. THE FINAL SET OF SERVICES AND SOFTWARE COMPRISING THE YOUHOLD PLATFORM MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE DESCRIBED IN THESE TERMS, IN WHICH CASE, THESE TERMS WILL BE AMENDED ACCORDINGLY. 

THE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUHOLD PLATFORM’S SERVICES PROVIDED ON THE YOUHOLD.NET WEBSITE SHALL BE DEEMED INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF YOUHOLD PLATFORM FOR THE PURPOSES OF THESE TERMS.

It is important that you read and understand these Terms as they govern your use of the YouHold Services. These Terms contain a binding arbitration provision, which affects your legal rights and may be enforced by the parties. By accessing or using the YouHold Services, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must immediately stop using the YouHold Services.

We may amend these Terms at any time by posting a revised version on YouHold.com or any other website we maintain for purposes of providing the YouHold Services. Amended Terms are effective at the time we post them and your continued use of the YouHold Services constitutes your acceptance of any amended Terms. We may provide you with notice regarding upcoming changes to the Terms by email.


				</p>

				<h1 class="terms-heading">YouHold Accounts.<h1>
				<p class="terms-para">
YouHold is planning to provide a software platform. The YouHold Platform will give you the ability to send electronic payments to Merchants and other Users, as well as in certain cases, receive a bank card from one of our licensed partners. All funds transfers will be facilitated by licensed third-party platforms and YouHold does not and will not receive, hold, or transmit funds.

				</p>

				<h1 class="terms-heading">Using YouHold.<h1>
				<p class="terms-para">
User Accounts will be set up to allow you to make payments through YouHold Platform, purchase third-party goods and services, if offered to be purchased through the YouHold Platform, locate Merchants and participate in promotions. Merchant accounts are set up primarily to allow the receipt of payments from Users through the YouHold Platform, primarily for business purposes and not primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. As a User, you may be recommended to setup PIN lock and/or (to the extent your device allows), fingerprint identification with respect to transactions you make with the use of the YouHold Platform.
				</p>

				<h1 class="terms-heading">Your privacy.<h1>
				<p class="terms-para">
Your privacy is very important to YouHold. When you register for an Account, you confirm that you have read and accepted the YouHold Privacy Policy.
				</p>

				<h1 class="terms-heading">Accuracy of information.<h1>
				<p class="terms-para">
When you register for an Account, you may be required to provide information that will allow us to verify your identity, including but not limited to: a valid US physical address (not including P.O. Boxes or commercial mail receiving agencies), phone number, bank or credit union account information, your photo, a copy of your photo identification, and your tax identification or social security number. You agree to provide true and accurate information to YouHold when you create your Account. You also agree to update this information to keep it true and accurate at all times. If you are a Merchant, we may request you to sufficiently identify your business, including by providing the above information with respect to your business, as well as to confirm the identity of your authorized representative, including such authorized representative’s full name, phone number, photo identification and such other information as we may reasonably require.
				</p>

				<h1 class="terms-heading">Authentication. <h1>
				<p class="terms-para">
You may be required to provide additional information or documentation to allow YouHold to verify your identity and/or your Account information. YouHold may also verify your information against third party databases or other sources and you authorize YouHold to make such inquiries.
				</p>	

				<h1 class="terms-heading">Password security. <h1>
				<p class="terms-para">
You are responsible for keeping your Account login information, password, and PIN secure. If you share your Account credentials with another person, you are responsible for all activity that person conducts using your Account, regardless of whether or not you authorized the activity.
				</p>

				<h1 class="terms-heading">Authorization to debit your linked bank or credit union account. <h1>
				<p class="terms-para">
If you link a bank card or a bank or credit union account to your Account (“Connected Account”), the bank or credit union must be a state or federally-chartered institution in the United States. When you make a payment that is funded by Connected Account, you are authorizing YouHold’s licensed partners to initiate an electronic transfer from one of your Connected Accounts in the amount you specify. You are solely responsible for complying with any terms set by your bank or credit union with respect to your Connected Account, including any fee terms, such as non-sufficient fund or overdraft fee terms. If you are entitled to a Reversal (as defined below), refund, or other adjustment associated with a payment you made using the YouHold Platform, you also authorize YouHold and its licensed partners to credit your Connected Account to complete that transaction.
				</p>

				<h1 class="terms-heading">Payment confirmations and Automated Clearing House clearing times. <h1>
				<p class="terms-para">
If you have a Connected Account, you may add funds to your Account, withdraw money from your Account, or send a payment using your Connected Account. If you do so, you acknowledge that normal Automated Clearing House clearing times will apply. This means that the funds should generally be available to you or your recipient within 4 business days. Payment confirmations sent within the YouHold Platform indicate that a payment was authorized by the paying User in the YouHold Platform, rather than the fact that the relevant amount was transferred to the recipient, such as a Merchant. The transfer itself will be subject to Automated Clearing House rules. When making payments to a Merchant through the YouHold Platform, a User must at all times ensure that there are sufficient funds in the User’s Account. If the User does not have sufficient funds on the Account, we will debit any of your other Connected Accounts or credit cards (to the extent connected to the YouHold Platform). YouHold will have the right promptly to recover from the User any such amount with applicable fees, penalties or other charges.

				<h1 class="terms-heading">Disputes with YouHold.<h1>
				<p class="terms-para">		
				Binding arbitration. You and YouHold (the “Parties") agree that upon the election of either of the Parties, any past, present, or future dispute relating in any way to your Account, or any other past, present, or future relationship or transaction between the Parties, will be resolved by binding arbitration as discussed below, and not through litigation in any court. Such disputes are called "Claims" for purposes of this agreement. This binding agreement to arbitrate applies regardless of whether the dispute is between you and us jointly or separately. This arbitration agreement is entered into pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator acting under the administration of United States Arbitration and Mediation, MidWest,Inc., and in accordance with the then-applicable United States Arbitration and Mediation Rules of Arbitration. Unless the Parties agree otherwise, or unless the arbitration administrator's rules or law require otherwise, the arbitration shall be held in Chicago, IL.
				The arbitrator will decide the Claim in accordance with all applicable law, including recognized principles of equity and statutes of limitations, and will honor all privileges recognized by law. The arbitrator will have the authority to award to a Party any damages or relief provided for under applicable law. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and legally binding, and may be enforced by any court having jurisdiction.
				No class actions or similar process, and no joinder or consolidation of any Claim with a Claim of any other person or entity, shall be allowable in arbitration, without the written consent of both Parties. The arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain any Claim on behalf of a class, group, person, or entity who is not a named party to the arbitration, nor shall any arbitrator have authority to make any award for the benefit of, or against, any class, group, person, or entity who is not a named party to the arbitration. In the event that there is a dispute about whether limiting arbitration to non-class proceedings, or to the named parties, is enforceable under applicable law, then that question shall be resolved by a court rather than by an arbitrator; and to the extent it is determined that resolution of a Claim must proceed on a class basis, it shall so proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction rather than in arbitration. If you elect to proceed with respect any Claim by an individual action in a small claims court, or its equivalent, instead of arbitration, we will not object, however, any such action shall be taken in small claims court in Chicago, IL.
				If the arbitrator or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator's rules or applicable law. Apart from the foregoing, each Party will be responsible for any other fees or costs, such as attorney fees that the Party may incur. If you consider that you are unable to afford any fees or costs that would be yours to pay, you may request that we pay or reimburse them, and we will consider your request in good faith.
				Arbitration with respect to a Claim is binding and neither Party will have the right to litigate that Claim through a court. In arbitration the Parties will not have the same rights that apply in court, such as the right to a trial by judge or jury and the right to participate or be represented in proceedings brought by others such as class actions or similar proceedings. In addition, the right to discovery and the right to appeal may also be limited or eliminated in arbitration. All of these judicial rights are waived with respect to Claims that the Parties elect to arbitrate.
